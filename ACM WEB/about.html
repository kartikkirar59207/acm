This project is a prototype version of a URL shortener built using basic web technologies. At this stage, it mainly demonstrates the core functionality, such as generating shortened links. Since I am still in the learning phase, I havenâ€™t yet explored advanced frontend design principles or backend development for features like global accessibility, database integration, or user account management. My current goal was to understand the working of simple web projects and build a foundation for future learning. In the coming months, I plan to dive deeper into both frontend and backend development, which will allow me to enhance this project further and turn it into a complete, fully functional application
